## Overview

CPU scheduling is a critical component in operating systems that determines the order in which processes access the CPU. This repository contains implementations of several classic scheduling algorithms, including:

- **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
- **Round Robin (RR)**
- **Priority Scheduling**
- **Multilevel Queue Scheduling**

Each algorithm is implemented with clarity and accompanied by sample test cases, detailed comments, and documentation to help you understand the underlying logic and design choices.

## Features

- **Clear and Concise Code:** Easy-to-read implementations with comments explaining key concepts.
- **Modular Design:** Each algorithm is separated into its own file/module for simplicity and reusability.
- **Extensible:** Add new scheduling algorithms or enhancements with minimal changes to the overall project structure.
- **Testing Suite:** Robust unit tests to ensure the correctness of each algorithm.
- **Educational Resources:** Inline documentation and usage examples that can help you learn and understand CPU scheduling.

## Implemented Algorithms

Below is a brief description of each algorithm included in this repository:

- **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served):**  
  Processes are scheduled in the order they arrive, ensuring fairness but possibly leading to long wait times if a long process is at the front of the queue.

- **SJF (Shortest Job First):**  
  Selects the process with the shortest execution time. It minimizes the average waiting time but requires knowledge of the upcoming process durations.

- **Round Robin (RR):**  
  Each process is given a fixed time slot (quantum) in a cyclic order. This algorithm improves responsiveness in a time-sharing environment.

- **Priority Scheduling:**  
  Processes are scheduled based on priority levels. This method can be preemptive or non-preemptive and is useful for systems where certain tasks require higher importance.

- **Multilevel Queue Scheduling:**  
  Processes are divided into multiple queues based on their priority or type, with different scheduling algorithms applied to each queue.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (or your preferred language/environment if implementations are in another language)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for cloning the repository
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) (if running tests)

> **Note:** If your implementations require other dependencies, please refer to the individual algorithm documentation or the requirements file.
